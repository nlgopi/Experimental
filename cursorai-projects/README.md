# Cursor AI experiments

This repository contains experiments with Cursor AI, demonstrating its capabilities in assisting with code development.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Node.js (version 12 or higher)
2. Cursor AI

### Installing Cursor AI

To download and install Cursor AI:

1. Visit the official Cursor website: [https://cursor.sh/](https://cursor.sh/)
2. Click on the "Download" button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
3. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website

## Projects

### Hello Cursor Server

A simple Node.js server that displays an animated "Hello Cursor" message with a stylish input box.

#### How to build hellocursor.js

1. Create a new file named `hellocursor.js`
2. Use Cursor AI to generate the initial server code
3. Refine the code with Cursor AI to add HTML content, styling, and animations
4. Further improve the design by adding a fancy text box and a custom background

#### Prompts used to build hellocursor.js

The following prompts were used with Cursor AI to create and refine the hellocursor.js file:

1. "Can you create a node js server that start up and the default page prints Hello Cursor"
2. "Can you center the Hello Cursor text and add some animation on top of it with a text box"
3. "Can you refine the text box to be fancy and stylish. The default text box looks plain. Can you also add a background image that shows that it is build by cursor."

These prompts demonstrate the iterative process of using AI to develop and improve code.

#### Running the server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `hellocursor.js`
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   node hellocursor.js
   ```
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

You should see a stylish page with an animated "Hello Cursor" message, a fancy text box, and a subtle keyboard emoji background.
